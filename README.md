## Introduction to evalITR  [![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/evalITR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=evalITR) ![CRAN downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/evalITR)

R package `evalITR` provides various statistical methods for evaluating Individualized Treatment Rules under randomized data. The provided metrics include Population Average Value (PAV), Population Average Prescription Effect (PAPE), Area Under Prescription Effect Curve (AUPEC). It also provides the tools to analyze Individualized Treatment Rules under budget constraints. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05389) for details.

This package is currently undergoing development to also provide statistical methods for estimation and evaluation of heterogeneous treatment effects discovered by generic machine learning methods under randomized experiments. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14511.pdf) for details.

## Installation Instructions

Package `evalITR` is available on CRAN and can be installed using:
