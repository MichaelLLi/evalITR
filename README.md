R package evalITR provides various statistical methods for estimating
and evaluating Individualized Treatment Rules under randomized data. The
provided metrics include (1) population average prescriptive effect
`PAPE`; (2) population average prescriptive effect with a budget
constraint `PAPEp`; (3) population average prescriptive effect
difference with a budget constraint `PAPDp`; (4) and area under the
prescriptive effect curve `AUPEC`; (5) Grouped Average Treatment Effects
`GATEs`. The details of the methods for this design are given in [Imai
and Li (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05389) and [Imai and
Li](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14511).
