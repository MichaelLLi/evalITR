## evalITR [![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/evalITR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=evalITR) ![CRAN downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/evalITR)

R package evalITR provides various statistical methods for estimating
and evaluating Individualized Treatment Rules under randomized data. The
provided metrics include (1) population average prescriptive effect
`PAPE`; (2) population average prescriptive effect with a budget
constraint `PAPEp`; (3) population average prescriptive effect
difference with a budget constraint `PAPDp`. This quantity will be
computed with more than 2 machine learning algorithms); (4) and area
under the prescriptive effect curve `AUPEC`, and (5) Grouped Average
Treatment Effects `GATEs`. The details of the methods for this design
are given in [Imai and Li (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05389) and
[Imai and Li (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14511). \*\*\*\*
