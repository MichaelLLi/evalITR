\usage{
compute_qoi_user(itr_function, Tcv, Ycv, tau, data, ngates, budget, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{itr_function}{A user-defined function to create an ITR. The function should take the data as input and return an ITR. The output is a vector of the unit-level binary treatment that would have been assigned by the individualized treatment rule. The default is \code{NULL}, which means the ITR will be estimated from the \code{estimate_itr}.}

\item{Tcv}{A vector of the unit-level binary treatment.}

\item{Ycv}{A vector of the unit-level continuous outcome.}

\item{tau}{A vector of the unit-level continuous score for treatment assignment. We assume those that have tau<0 should not have treatment. Conditional Average Treatment Effect is one possible measure.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables of interest.}

\item{ngates}{The number of gates to be used in the GATE function.}

\item{budget}{The maximum percentage of population that can be treated under the budget constraint.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the user-defined function.}
}
