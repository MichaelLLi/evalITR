\title{Estimation of the Population Average Prescription Effect in Randomized Experiments}
\usage{
PAPE(T, That, Y, budget = NA, centered = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{A vector of the unit-level binary treatment receipt variable for each sample.}

\item{That}{A vector of the unit-level binary treatment that would have been assigned by the
individualized treatment rule. If \code{budget} is specified, please ensure
that the percentage of treatment units of That is lower than the budget constraint.}

\item{Y}{A vector of the outcome variable of interest for each sample.}

\item{budget}{The maximum percentage of population that can be treated under the
budget constraint. Should be a decimal between 0 and 1. Default is NA which assumes
no budget constraint.}

\item{centered}{If \code{TRUE}, the outcome variables would be centered before processing. This minimizes
the variance of the estimator. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list that contains the following items: \item{pape}{The estimated
Population Average Prescription Effect.} \item{sd}{The estimated standard deviation
of PAPE.}
}
\description{
This function estimates the Population Average Prescription Effect with and without a budget
constraint. The details of the methods for this design are given in Imai and Li (2019).
