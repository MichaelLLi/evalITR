\title{Estimation of the Population Average Prescription Difference in Randomized Experiments}
\usage{
PAPD(T, Thatfp, Thatgp, Y, budget, centered = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{A vector of the unit-level binary treatment receipt variable for each sample.}

\item{Thatfp}{A vector of the unit-level binary treatment that would have been assigned by the
first individualized treatment rule. Please ensure that the percentage of treatment units of That is lower than the budget constraint.}

\item{Thatgp}{A vector of the unit-level binary treatment that would have been assigned by the
second individualized treatment rule. Please ensure that the percentage of treatment units of That is lower than the budget constraint.}

\item{Y}{A vector of the outcome variable of interest for each sample.}

\item{budget}{The maximum percentage of population that can be treated under the
budget constraint. Should be a decimal between 0 and 1.}

\item{centered}{If \code{TRUE}, the outcome variables would be centered before processing. This minimizes
the variance of the estimator. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list that contains the following items: \item{papd}{The estimated
Population Average Prescription Difference} \item{sd}{The estimated standard deviation
of PAPD.}
}
\description{
This function estimates the Population Average Prescription Difference with a budget
constraint. The details of the methods for this design are given in Imai and Li (2019).
