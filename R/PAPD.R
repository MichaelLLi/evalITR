#' Estimation of the Population Average Prescription Difference in Randomized Experiments
#'
#' This function estimates the Population Average Prescription Difference with a budget
#' constraint. The details of the methods for this design are given in Imai and Li (2019).
#'
#'
#'
#' @param T A vector of the unit-level binary treatment receipt variable for each sample.
#' @param Thatfp A vector of the unit-level binary treatment that would have been assigned by the
#' first individualized treatment rule. Please ensure that the percentage of treatment units of That is lower than the budget constraint.
#' @param Thatgp A vector of the unit-level binary treatment that would have been assigned by the
#' second individualized treatment rule. Please ensure that the percentage of treatment units of That is lower than the budget constraint.
#' @param Y A vector of the outcome variable of interest for each sample.
#' @param budget The maximum percentage of population that can be treated under the
#' budget constraint. Should be a decimal between 0 and 1.
#' @param centered If \code{TRUE}, the outcome variables would be centered before processing. This minimizes
#' the variance of the estimator. Default is \code{TRUE}.
#' @return A list that contains the following items: \item{papd}{The estimated
#' Population Average Prescription Difference} \item{sd}{The estimated standard deviation
#' of PAPD.}
